# Grand Workbench

Adds a unified workbench that brings most crafting recipes into a single, cleaner workbench UI.

## Features
One bench with multiple crafting tabs:
  - Workbench
  - Weapons
  - Armors
  - Alchemy
  - Arcane
  - Farming
  - Furniture
  - Cooking

## Crafting
The **Grand Workbench** can be crafted directly from your inventory or using a regular workbench.

## Warning (Tier Upgrades)
If you upgrade the Grand Workbench to **Tier 2** or **Tier 3** and then **break it**, the dropped item will behave like the ones from the currently base game:
- **It will drop as Tier 1** and **All tier upgrades will be lost**. So be careful!

## Models & Visuals
The current Tier 2 and Tier 3 models are **temporary** and only use color variations of the Tier 1 model.

More detailed and visually distinct models are **planned for future updates**.
